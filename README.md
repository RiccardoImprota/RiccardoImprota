I am currently studying data science while my background is in
sociology. I'm interested in Computational Social Science, a
discipline at the intersection of computer science, statistics, and
the social sciences.

I believe that domain knowledge - but especially a critical and
thought-out approach to data - is fundamental to good Data
Science.
