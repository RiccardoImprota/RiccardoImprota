I am currently pursuing a master's degree in Data Science and my background in sociology. I'm interested in Computational Social Science, a discipline at the intersection of computer science, statistics, and the social sciences.

I believe that domain knowledge - but especially a critical and thought-out approach to data - is fundamental to good Data Science.
